# FrostUK
## Project Overview

FrostMart is a large UK grocery retailer with over 800 stores nationwide, offering fresh produce, dairy, baked goods, and seasonal products such as Christmas and Easter specials. While these seasonal and perishable products are a major driver of customer loyalty and revenue, they also introduce significant operational challenges due to short shelf life, weather sensitivity, and unpredictable demand.

This project focuses on building a data-driven demand forecasting solution to help FrostMart better predict weekly demand for perishable products, reduce food waste, and avoid lost sales caused by under- or over-stocking. The work combines historical sales data, product information, store characteristics, weather conditions, and supplier constraints to support smarter inventory and procurement decisions.

A simple interactive demo is included to show how demand predictions can be generated for different product and store scenarios.

## Business Problem

Seasonal and perishable products account for approximately **35% of FrostMart’s annual revenue**, but they also represent one of the highest sources of operational risk.

Key challenges include:

- **Over-stocking**: which leads to food waste, markdown losses, and unnecessary storage costs

- **Under-stocking**: which results in missed sales opportunities, customer dissatisfaction, and reputational damage

- **Weather-driven demand spikes**: where sudden temperature changes can cause rapid increases in demand for chilled or seasonal items

- **Complex supply chain constraints**: including limited supplier capacity, cold-storage requirements, and long lead times for certain products

Together, these factors contribute to an estimated **£12.2 million annual impact**, split between excess inventory waste and lost revenue.

Traditional inventory planning methods struggle to handle this level of variability, particularly when weather, promotions, holidays, and regional differences interact.

## Project Objective

The primary goal of this project is to:

**Use predictive modelling to forecast weekly demand for perishable seasonal products, enabling data-driven inventory and procurement decisions across FrostMart’s store network.**

More specifically, the project aims to:

- Improve demand forecasting accuracy at both store and regional levels

- Reduce perishable food waste by aligning stock levels with expected demand

- Prevent stock-outs during peak seasonal periods

- Support evidence-based decision-making for procurement and supply chain planning

## Expected Impact

If applied in a real operational setting, the approach demonstrated in this project could support:

- 30–40% reduction in perishable food waste

- 10–20% increase in seasonal revenue capture through improved availability

- A shift from intuition-based planning to fully data-driven decision making

These improvements also align with sustainability goals and UK regulatory expectations around food waste reduction.
